From a young age, I was captivated by the intricacies of technology and its potential to transform our world. This fascination ignited a lifelong journey into the realm of programming, where I have honed my skills in various languages and frameworks, continually pushing the boundaries of what I can create.</p>

<p>Living in Stockholm—a hub of innovation and creativity—has only fueled my enthusiasm for software development.
